There are two categories within types:
* Primitive Types
    * number
    * boolean
    * void
    * undefined
    * string
    * symbol
    * null

* Object Types
    * functions
    * arrays
    * classes
    * objects

* Why do we care about types?
    * Types are used by the TS compiler to analyze our code for errors
    * Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase

* Type annotations
    * code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to
* Type Inference
    * Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
